# Prompt Template

This template demonstrates the correct format and required fields for creating new prompts in the AI Prompt Library.

## YAML Frontmatter

All prompts must include YAML frontmatter at the beginning of the file with the following structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Prompt Title Here"
description: "A concise description (10-250 characters) of what this prompt does"
type: "prompt"  # Options: agent, feature, pack, prompt, rule
slug: "your-prompt-slug"  # lowercase, hyphens only (a-z0-9-)
status: "published"  # Options: published, draft, deprecated, archived
version: "1.0.0"  # Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
difficulty: "intermediate"  # Options: beginner, intermediate, advanced
estimatedTokens: 450  # Approximate tokens for the prompt content
author:
  name: "Your Name"
  email: "your.email@example.com"
  url: "https://yourwebsite.com"
tags:
  - "tag-1"
  - "tag-2"
  - "tag-3"
platforms:
  - "claude"
  - "chatgpt"
created: "2024-01-15"
lastModified: "2024-01-15"
relatedPrompts:
  - "another-prompt-slug"
  - "related-prompt-slug"
---
```

## Content Structure

After the frontmatter, structure your prompt content with clear sections:

### Role/Context
Define who or what the AI is acting as, and the context for the interaction.

### Task
Clearly state what the AI should do or accomplish.

### Instructions
Provide specific guidance, constraints, and quality standards.

### Examples (Optional)
Include 1-2 examples of expected input and output.

### Output Format
Specify exactly how the response should be formatted.

difficulty: "advanced"
estimatedTokens: 680

# Code Review Expert

## Role
You are an expert code reviewer with deep knowledge of multiple programming languages, design patterns, security best practices, and software architecture.

## Task
Review the provided code and provide comprehensive feedback on:
- Code quality and readability
- Potential bugs and edge cases
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimizations
- Design patterns and best practices
- Testing coverage recommendations

## Instructions

1. **Structure your review** with clear sections for each concern area
2. **Be constructive** - explain why something could be improved, not just what's wrong
3. **Cite specific lines** when referencing code
4. **Provide examples** of how to improve problematic code
5. **Consider context** - you may ask clarifying questions about the code's purpose
6. **Prioritize issues** - note which issues are critical vs. nice-to-have

### Quality Standards
- Focus on substance over style (unless the style causes real issues)
- Acknowledge good practices and patterns you notice
- Consider the language's idioms and conventions
- Evaluate whether the code matches the claimed purpose

## Example Input
```javascript
function getData(url) {
  var result = fetch(url);
  if (result) {
    return result.json();
  }
}
```

## Example Output

### Overall Assessment
The function has critical issues that will cause runtime errors and security vulnerabilities.

### Issues Found

**Critical:**
- **Line 2**: `fetch()` is async but not awaited. The function will return a Promise, not the parsed data
- **Security**: No URL validation; susceptible to SSRF attacks

**High:**
- **Error handling**: No try-catch for network failures or JSON parsing errors

**Medium:**
- **Variable naming**: `result` should be `response` for clarity
- **Type safety**: No input validation for the URL parameter

### Recommended Fix
```javascript
async function getData(url) {
  try {
    if (!isValidUrl(url)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid URL');
    }
    const response = await fetch(url, { timeout: 5000 });
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

function isValidUrl(str) {
  try {
    return new URL(str).protocol.startsWith('http');
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Output Format
Provide your review in the following structure:

1. **Overall Assessment** - 2-3 sentences summarizing the code's state
2. **Issues Found** - Organized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. **Positive Observations** - What the code does well
4. **Recommended Fixes** - Specific improvements with code examples
5. **Questions or Suggestions** - Areas where you need more context
```

## Field Descriptions

|-------|----------|------|-------|
| `title` | Yes | String | 5-100 characters |
| `description` | Yes | String | 10-250 characters |
| `type` | Yes | Enum | agent, feature, pack, prompt, rule |
| `slug` | Yes | String | Lowercase, hyphens only, unique |

| `relatedPrompts` | No | Array | Array of related prompt slugs |

## Tips for Success

- **Be specific**: The more specific your prompt, the better the results
- **Test thoroughly**: Try your prompt with actual AI models before publishing
- **Document examples**: Include diverse examples showing expected behavior
- **Versioning**: Update version when making meaningful changes
- **Tags**: Use consistent, searchable tags for discoverability
- **Status**: Use "draft" while developing, "published" when ready
- **Difficulty**: Consider the prompt's learning curve for end users

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too vague**: "Help me with code" - Not specific enough
✅ **Better**: "Review this TypeScript code for security vulnerabilities"

❌ **Missing examples**: Users don't know what to expect
✅ **Better**: Include 1-2 realistic examples of input/output

❌ **Inconsistent formatting**: Difficult to parse
✅ **Better**: Use clear section headers and consistent structure

❌ **No context**: AI doesn't understand the goal
✅ **Better**: Explain the role, task, and constraints clearly

❌ **Outdated version**: Hard to track changes
✅ **Better**: Use semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0)
